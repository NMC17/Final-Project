# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
To Be Determined

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
A webscraping (or pdf-scraping) program that collects all of the congressional records of the past 20 years and allows you to search individual representatives and senators to see their position on subjects.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
My software will allow the user to look up what any US Senator or Representative says on the floor of Congress by sourcing from a database of 20 years of Congressional transcripts from Congressional Sessions. It will include a search engine that allows the user to look up an individual Congressperson, and on top of that, to filter their results to a certain political subtopic (such as Gun Laws, Abortion, Housing, Climate Change, etc.)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
